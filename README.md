# SteamGridDB for Xbox

An Xbox Game Bar widget to replace artwork generated by the Xbox PC app to a higher quality one from SteamGridDB.

Currently supports games from Steam, GOG and Ubisoft. 

Battle.net is unlikely to be ever supported because Xbox app does not store its images in the same way as other stores, and games from Battle.net usually already have a high quality cover art.

The widget requires user to enable File system access under *Settings > Privacy & security > File system > Let apps access your file system*, because by default it runs in a sandboxed environment where it is not allowed to access data of the other apps such as the Xbox app - this is the only way to enable such functionality. The only files being accessed are the Xbox app images downloaded for games installed from the third-party libraries.

Currently known issues and limitations:
- Epic library is not supported yet (investigating how to map game ID generated by the Xbox app to an Epic Store ID);
- Sometimes the Xbox app does not fully clean up data for removed games - those entries will show up in the widget, but they can not be modified;
- Only first 50 square grids and first 50 icons are loaded from SteamGridDB (paging is not implemented yet).
